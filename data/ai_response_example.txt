crapwer step:
*globals* -
~ colors_set =  create a set of all the colors: {for example: {'Black, Red, Gold, Silver,purple,green , yellow, pink etc} }
~ celebrity_color_list = clean the color data and save it to a list by intersect the colors_set with the json[colors] 
will get a list like this  [Black, Red, Gold, Silver, purple, green] (after turning the set into a list)
~ cur_gender -click on the gender tab  and chose the gender of the famous person json['gender']
~ CATEGORIES = [hat, glasses, jewelry, tops, pants, shoes, colors]

*main logic*
outer for loop:
init crawler:
for each key in the CATEGORIES
1)  fashion_products = json[key] (extract the product breakdown) in the main page of asos : 'https://www.asos.com/women/'

    inner for loop:
    init scraping: here will start the search
    for each product in fashion_products (from the outer list),
    1) find the search bar selector
    2) insert as input into the search bar the product (for example 'Cat-eye sunglasses') and search
    3) find the filter bar selector
    4) find the Gender tab and click on gender which is the same as the global cur_gender
    5) find the Colour tab and click on all the color that are in the global celebrity_color_list
    6) scrape the data from the page (probabily url, image, price) and save it into a data structure

example for the price values type:{'value': 91.84, 'text': '91.84 ILS'} meaning value key is a string, and its value is a number

in the db ill save the the celebrity_name as a key and the prompt itself as a value for future scraping


in the React app the structure will be:
Frontend folder:
file - App.tsx
Folders - [src -> [assets, Modules,Pages, ]]
Modules -> [ components (to define the component like factory), views (the components themselves we'll use in our
pages.tsx file
 we init with the component factory)]
for example in the Pages folder will make the Home.tsx and will use a navbar call AppAppbar from the view folder, and it will be of type
AppBar declared in the components' folder]



need to make an enum for the ai_json_like_data: dict[str, str] structure
this is the structre we get from the llm FashionAi after predict and parts
